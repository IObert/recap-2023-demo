# Demo Code

This is the code as I've showed it during recap 2023. I'll link the recording here once it becomes available (feel free to ping me if I forget this).

The UI code is based on [this blog post](https://medium.com/@marius.obert/getting-started-with-fundamental-library-styles-in-2023-a4faa28575da).
